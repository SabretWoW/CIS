# CIS: Custom Ink Shortener

## Run the app: [https://ci-shorten.herokuapp.com/](https://ci-shorten.herokuapp.com/)

This is the URL shortener for the Custom Ink coding exercise. The requirements are:

* A [form that submits the URL](https://github.com/kyletcarlson/CIS/blob/main/app/views/layouts/_hero.html.erb) to be shortened

* After submission, [displays the shortened URL](https://github.com/kyletcarlson/CIS/blob/main/app/views/short_links/_users_last_short_link.html.erb).

* When the user clicks on the shortened URL it should [expand to the full (original) URL](https://github.com/kyletcarlson/CIS/blob/main/app/views/short_links/_users_last_short_link.html.erb).
